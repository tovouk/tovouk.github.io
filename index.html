            <p>I took the time to make this to share a little about myself. For starters, this has nothing to do with programming.
               Although I believe learning problem solving skills are important, as are building solutions, we as developers must
               not forget the truly important things in life. Far too often is the case for a developer to commit to their work and
               neglect their personal life.
            </p>
            <p>Do not neglect your family or your partner for the sake of achievement. You can always achieve something, but time
               with your loved ones is limited. Definitely strive to achieve your best, but do continue to show appreciation and care
               for those important to you. If you're in a situation where you think it is already too late, think again. Relationships
               aren't black and white and are repairable. Some circumstances make things tough for sure, but do what you can to show
               them that you care.
            </p>
            <p>When it comes to learning something, be flexible. There is usually more than one way to learn, find what works best for you.
               Also, keep in mind that there is more than one place to learn something. Whether it be in school, udemy, Udacity, or anywhere else,
               don't limit yourself to learning in one place if possible. This does not mean spread yourself thin, but different environments
               can produce different results. Do not become complacent and seek other means when you're able to.
            </p>
            <p>If you're working in a team be sure to treat your team members with respect. It is not always possible for two people to see
               eye to eye when working on a project. Remember the end goal that your team is tasked with completing and do what is best in 
               helping reach that goal. If you find yourself in arguments with someone often, it is likely that things are getting out of hand
               and there is a need to reframe yourself. A team should work together and cooperate, at the end of the day you're at work and
               keeping a positive environment is more likely to help you in more ways than one with constant tension.
            </p>
            <p>Make time for yourself. Do what you like to do and do not feel guilty about not being productive 24/7. There is no need to be
               productive all the time. You are human and need to express yourself somehow. This is your life and if you take yourself out of
               the equation then what are you living for? I do not mean this in a negative way. I ask this question simply to remind those that
               need to be reminded that they are worth their own time. There is a time for work, but there is also a time for play.
